Problem Statement
Given a singly linked list consisting of N Nodes, your task is to convert it into a circular linked list.

Note:- For custom input you will get 1 if your code is correct else you get a 0.

Note:Examples in Sample Input and Output just shows how a linked list will look like depending on the questions. Do not copy-paste as it is in custom input


/*
class Node {
    Node next;
    int val;

    Node(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        next = null;
    }
}
*/
public static Node MakeCircular(Node head) {
//enter your code here
Node s=head;
while(s.next!=null)
s=s.next;
s.next=head;
return head;
}
