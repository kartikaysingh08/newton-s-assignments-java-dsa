Problem Statement
Given two integers N and M, your task is to print the number of primes present between N and M (both included).

Note:- You have already provided a function that will check if the given number is prime or not. To use the given function you need to call check_prime(x) where x is the number you want to check. If the given number is prime the function will return 1 else it returns 0.

Note:- Do not close your main class.
Input
The input contains two space- separated integers depicting the values of N and M.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= M <= 10000
Output
Print the count of prime numbers in the given range.
Example
Sample Input:-
1 10

Sample Output:-
4

Sample Input:-
8 10

Sample Output:-
0
