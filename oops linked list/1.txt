Problem Statement
Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse the list by changing links between nodes (i.e if the list is 1->2->3->4 then it becomes 1<-2<-3<-4) and return the head of the modified list.

//public static Node ReverseLinkedList(Node head) {
		// return the head of the modified linked list
        public static Node ReverseLinkedList(Node head) {

        Node prev = null; 
        Node current = head; 
        Node next = null; 
        while (current != null) { 
            next = current.next; 
            current.next = prev; 
            prev = current; 
            current = next; 
        } 
        head = prev; 
        return head; 
    }
